## Description
This hands-on workshop, aimed at developers and solution builders, introduces how to leverage LLMs for RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation).

In this case,
* we bring kNN to search solutions of related problems by AWS Opensearch;
* Use one of LLM models to do analysis for all related content and rendering with streamed response from the LLM model.
